# Intrinsic Ratio Generator/Calculator

In 2009, Thierry Koblentz wrote about Intrinsic Ratios, specifically in regards to videos. By now they're used everywhere, or should be, thanks to RWD. I found myself whipping out a calculator once too often, so I made a simple LESS mixin to do the math for me in 2013. Checkout the [coderwall post](https://coderwall.com/p/jn8xlw).

In an effort to learn something new I decided to build a calculator with raw Javascript in my free time. Consider the conversion to ReactJS as nothing more than a learning exercise.
